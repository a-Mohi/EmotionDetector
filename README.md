# Image Classification with TensorFlow

The project is a deep learningâ€“based system designed to classify human emotions (happy/sad) from images. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras to automatically learn visual features from facial expressions and predict the corresponding emotion class.
